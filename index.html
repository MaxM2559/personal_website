                <p>Hello there! I'm Max Ma and welcome to my website. I am currently a student at Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences double majoring in Economics and Information Science (Data Science).<br><br> I am pursuing a career path in using data science for various applications. I am interested in studying the effects blockchain and cryptocurrencies could have on businesses and governments.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of my studies, I am also interested in cooking, playing guitar, taiko drumming, and stressing over how much protein is in each meal.</p>

                <h3>Edugion, June 2022 - August 2022</h3>
                <p>Worked for a start-up called Edugion, where I came up with solutions to a variety of data-related problems, from creating programs that interact with Excel sheets to visualizing thousands of data points with Leaflet. <br><br>
                    Because of the start-up environment, I had experience approaching problems from many different angles and designing outside-the-box solutions.
                    Mainly used Python and Javascript but I also learned and used R, HTML, and the Leaflet API.<br><br></p>

                <h3>Interactive Cluster Map with Automatic Categories</h3>
                <p>A mapping tool that creates a map and marks every point of data from a data set. These points are automatically sorted by their given category and can be manually hidden/clustered with the layer control menu at the top right. The focus for this project was a proof of concept that a map representing thousands of data points while being user readible was possible. <a href="https://leafletmapdemo.surge.sh/#close">Demo</a>

                <h3>Research Project: Participation of team sports by high school students influence on underage drinking?</h3>
                <p>Was part of a research team that investigated the effect of high schoolers' regular participation in team sports on the probability of involvement in gambling-related activities. Through conducting various regressions on Stata, we found that the relationship between participation in sports and gambling-related activities was positive and significant. We utilized Stata with survey data from the High School Risk Survey from 2006.

                <h3>Lambda Ledge: Game Level Generator</h3>
                <p>As part of the semester long final project for my Functional Programming course, my team developed a working 2D platformer game, complete with powerups, abilities, and levels. Our main focus was creating an intuitive level generator, individuals with no coding experience could easily create their own level designs in a text file which is then read and turned into an actual level in the game.
