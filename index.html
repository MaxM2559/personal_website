                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Max Ma, a senior at Cornell University studying Economics and Data Science. I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights in economics and business, with experience spanning projects involving government and education data analysis to exploring innovative business applications of blockchain technology. Outside of academics, I lead practices for the Cornell Taiko Club, rehearse with the Cornell Orchestra, and experiment with new recipes in the kitchen.

                    <p>
                        As part of a class of a research team, I analyzed the impact of high school students' regular participation in team sports on their likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors such as gambling. Using data from the 2006 High School Risk Survey, we used Stata to conduct linear , multilinear , and logistic regression analyses. Our findings revealed a positive and statistically significant relationship between sports participation and gambling-like behavior.

Lambda Ledge is complete with movement, powerups, and levels.

I also helped analyze, read, and write research papers with the Cornell Economics Department faculty.  At the end of my program, I presented the work accomplished over the summer to program donors and we plan on presenting our findings in future conferences.
